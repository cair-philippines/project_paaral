"""Optimized network construction utilities for school routing analysis.

This module defines :class:`OptimizedSchoolNetworkBuilder`, the central
utility for constructing optimized road networks and computing routes
between schools. Both public **and private** schools inside the target
administrative boundary are treated as origin points. The builder
converts road data from NetworkX to ``igraph`` and uses spatial indexing
for fast queries on a single master graph so that routes for many
schools can be computed efficiently.
