"""Extended network builder that treats both public and private schools as origins.

This module provides :class:`MixedOriginNetworkBuilder`, a subclass of
:class:`OptimizedSchoolNetworkBuilder`.  The new builder processes public and
private schools in the same run so that distance matrices include routes from
all school types.  Use it when both public and private schools should act as
origin points.
